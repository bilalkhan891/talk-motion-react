              When our founder and CEO, Faraz Tamboli, heard about a story from his dad of a deaf
              and aphonic child named Mona who was unable to communicate with him. Listening to how
              Mona was misunderstood, underestimated, and dismissed and how these gaps in
              communication created two different worlds, Faraz knew something needed to be done.
              And so TalkMotion was born to connect these two worlds! TalkMotion is a cloud-based
              communication technology that helps deaf and aphonic people communicate easily with
              each other in school, at home, or in the workplace. We built this app because we
              believe that communication is a fundamental human need, and no one should have to feel
              restricted or excluded from being able to communicate freely. We provide an
              easy-to-use platform for deaf and aphonic people in both professional and personal
              environments by making it easy for them to connect with each other. Whether you&#39;re
              looking for friends who can sign or just want an easier way to talk at work,
              TalkMotion has got you covered!
